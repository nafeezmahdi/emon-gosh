            My past research works were intended to tackle low resource NLP,
            covering areas like <em>natural language generation</em>,{" "}
            <em>summarization</em>, <em>question answering (QA)</em>, and{" "}
            <em>interpretability of language models</em>. I had utilized
            cutting-edge techniques like <em>generative</em> and{" "}
            <em>contrastive learning</em> to improve language generation and{" "}
            <em>representation learning</em> for low resource language.
            Additionally, I had applied natural language processing in specific{" "}
            <em>software engineering (SE)</em> tasks.
